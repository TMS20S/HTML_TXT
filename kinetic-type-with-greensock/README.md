##An emotional reading experience
<p style="color:#ddd;">Kinetic type has always fascinated me, but the video format hasn't. It's so limiting. Once a video is rendered – you're done. You can't do much else with it. With code tho... the journey has just begun. You can change it, make it interactive and reuse it in a million different ways. You're only limited by your creativity and your coding skills.</p>

<p style="color:#ddd;">Kinetic type is the mix of text and motion. If done right, the reading experience can really come to life with story and emotion. The message is no longer only in the text, but in the imagination of the user.</p>

<p style="color:#ddd;">This script weighs in on only 3 Kb... that seriously makes me happy. 3 Kb is negligible. It's virtually nothing. You could have a hundred scripts like these and probably not notice any difference in loading time. That's powerful!</p>

<p style="color:#ddd;">So let's animate more in the browsers, shall we?</p>
<p style="color:#ddd;">This was so much fun to build!</p>
